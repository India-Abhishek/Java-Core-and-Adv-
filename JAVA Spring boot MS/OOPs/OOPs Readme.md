OOPs - object oriented programming

Object - everything around us is and object - pen, laptop, chair
            object have properties Ex - pen have color, body..
            object have behavior - we can write with the pen
            (Every object does something)

            create an object

            class name  object name = new classname();

            i.e.
            Calculator calc = new Calculator();
>> Anonyomous Object 
                new calc(); called anonyomous object because it dont have a name.
        
        >>WE CANT USE anonyomous object AGAIN.

                //reference object
                Calc c; it have the ref. of the object.

Class - to create an object, we need to create a class
        A blue print to create an object in java = JVM creates an objects in java.
        WE create a class file >> this class file get compiled to crrate a byte code>> byte code goes to the JVM and creates an object.
        Class consist of blocks, constructor, variables, methods, inner classes and inner interfaces.

Encapsulation - 
        private variable is only access witthin the class.

Package: Storing files in folders is called packages

polymorphism - same object can have diffrent behaviour is called polymorphism.
